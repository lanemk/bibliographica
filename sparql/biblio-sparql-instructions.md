## SPARQL query instructions (bibliographica)

Queries listed below draw from the bibliographica ontology/dataset. 
 - All SPARQL processing here is done through the
   [SPARQLer General Purpose Processor](http://sparql.org/sparql.html), a simple SPARQL endpoint. I see no way to cite the owners of the site/service, but they deserve credit.
 - Output data for each question can be seen by clicking **Get Results**. For easier reading by humans, I recommend selecting **Text** as the **output** type from the pull-down menu below the query field.
