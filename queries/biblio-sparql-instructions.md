## SPARQL query instructions (bibliographica)

Queries listed below draw from the bibliographica ontology/dataset. Actual scripts are in the **sparql** directory of this repository.  
 - Output data for each question can be seen by clicking **RESULTS**.  
 - All SPARQL processing here is done through the
   [SPARQLer General Purpose Processor](http://sparql.org/sparql.html), a simple SPARQL endpoint. I see no way to cite the owners of the site/service, but they deserve credit.
